GPU Fractals
============
This is a XCode project that compliles for Mac OSX the example programs from the ["Fast and easy high resolution fractals with a pixel shader"](http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/sdr_fract/) article by John Tsiombikas.

Only minor code changes where needed for it to run. Essentialy the GLUT imports where changed and some tipe conversion warnings where fixed. I've tested it on Mavericks and it works flawlessly.
